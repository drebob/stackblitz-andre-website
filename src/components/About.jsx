      My journey in graphic and web design started with personalizing my MySpace profile and evolved into a career crafting digital experiences for diverse industries. Iâ€™ve designed and developed websites for <a href="retail1031.com" className="font-semibold" target="_blank" aria-label="Retail 1031 (opens in a new tab)">commercial real estate</a>, a <a href="" className="font-semibold" target="_blank" aria-label="Petosa Accordions (opens in a new tab)">century-old accordion manufacturer</a>, and most recently <a href="brownies.com com" className="font-semibold" target="_blank" aria-label="Fairytale Brownies(opens in a new tab)">brownies.com</a>.

        My role involves not just web design but also merchandising, data analytics, and collaborating with back-end developers. Although I wear many hats, my main priority is creating user-friendly, attractive websites that stand out, aiming for improved user engagement and conversion rates.

           When I'm not at a computer, I'm probably playing piano, playing video games, exercising, or spending quality time with friends and my dog, Brutus.
