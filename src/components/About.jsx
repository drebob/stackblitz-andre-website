      My journey in graphic and web design started with personalizing my MySpace profile and evolved into a career crafting digital experiences for diverse industries. Iâ€™ve designed and developed websites for commercial real estate, a century-old accordion manufacturer, and most recently brownies.com.

        My role involves not just web design but also merchandising, data analytics, and collaborating with back-end developers. Although I wear many hats, my main priority is creating user-friendly, attractive websites that stand out, aiming for improved user engagement and conversion rates.

           When I'm not at a computer, I'm probably playing piano, playing video games, exercising, or spending quality time with friends and my dog, Brutus.
